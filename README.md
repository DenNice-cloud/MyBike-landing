# MyBike Sales Site

I created a product site model for a bicycle sales company called **MyBike**.

### HOME Page

- Displays the main product: bicycles.
- Clickable logo.
- Clickable telephone number that leads to a dialer.
- Three bars that open a sidebar menu with site navigation. Each menu item is clickable and takes you to a section of the page.

### MOVE FREE Section

- Contains an inspirational statement.

### COMPARE BIKES Section

- Lists three clickable bikes.

### DETAILS Section

- Provides a more detailed description of the visuals and structure of the bikes.
- Includes a clickable Explore button.

### CONTACTS Section

- Fields to fill in information:
  - Requaired: Name, Email
  - Optional: Message
- Clickable Send button that updates the input fields.
- Clickable headers:
  - Phone: suggests dialing a number.
  - Email: suggests writing an email.
  - Address: redirects to Google Maps.

## Technologies 

- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons are fully clickable, including phone numbers, email addresses, and the address, which links to Google Maps.
- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Development Environment**: The site was developed using Visual Studio Code.
  - **Front-End Design**: Utilizes HTML and SCSS.
  - **Package Management**: npm was used to manage and install necessary packages.
