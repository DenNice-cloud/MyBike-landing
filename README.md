Project Description: MyBike Sales Site

I created a product site model for a bicycle sales company called MyBike. The key features of the site include:

- Interactive Elements: All buttons are fully clickable, including phone numbers, email addresses, and the address, which links to Google Maps.
- Technology Stack: The site was developed using Visual Studio Code. It utilizes HTML and SCSS for the front-end design. Additionally, npm was used to manage and install necessary packages.

You can see the result of code here:
