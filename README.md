# MyBike Sales Site

I created a product site model for a bicycle sales company called **MyBike**. The key features of the site include:

## Key Features

- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons are fully clickable, including phone numbers, email addresses, and the address, which links to Google Maps.
- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Development Environment**: The site was developed using Visual Studio Code.
  - **Front-End Design**: Utilizes HTML and SCSS.
  - **Package Management**: npm was used to manage and install necessary packages.
